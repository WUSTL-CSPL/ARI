ArduPPM is the generic code name for boards or chips responsible for ppm encoding.




Available firmwares :


ATMega328p : second generation ppm encoder code designed for APM v1.x boards using ATMega328P.


ATMega32U2 : second generation ppm encoder code designed for boards using ATMega16U2 or ATMega32U2 (PhoneDrone and future APM boards).






APM v1.x users are welcome to use the new ppm encoder code (ATMega328p).

This firmware should solve compatibility or reliability problems that can be seen with "difficult" receivers.
