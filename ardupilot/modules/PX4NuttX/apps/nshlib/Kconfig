config NSH_ROMFSSECTSIZE
	int "ROMFS sector size"
	default 64
	---help---
		This is the sector size to use with the ROMFS volume.  Since the
		default volume is very small, this defaults to 64 but should be
		increased if the ROMFS volume were to be become large.  Any value
		selected must be a power of 2.

config NSH_ARCHROMFS
	bool "Architecture-specific ROMFS header"
	default n
	depends on NSH_ROMFSETC
	---help---
		Enable this option to provide an architecture-specific ROMFS

		FAT FS will be NSH_FATSECTSIZE * NSH_FATNSECTORS bytes.

config NSH_FATMOUNTPT
	string "FAT mount point"
	default "/tmp"
	depends on FS_FAT
	---help---
		When the default rcS file used when NSH_ROMFSETC is selected, it

	bool "Use console"
	default y
	---help---
		If NSH_CONSOLE is set to 'y', then a character driver
		console front-end is selected (/dev/console).

		Normally, the serial console device is a UART and RS-232
		interface.  However, if USBDEV is defined, then a USB
		serial device may, instead, be used if the one of
		the following are defined:

		PL2303 and PL2303_CONSOLE - Set up the Prolifics PL2303
		emulation as a console device at /dev/console.

		CDCACM and CDCACM_CONSOLE - Set up the CDC/ACM serial
		device as a console device at dev/console.

		NSH_USBCONSOLE and NSH_USBCONDEV - Sets up some other USB
		serial device as the NSH console (not necessarily dev/console).

config NSH_USBCONSOLE
	bool "Use a USB console"
	default n
	depends on NSH_CONSOLE && USBDEV
	---help---
		If defined, then the an arbitrary USB device may be used
		to as the NSH console.  In this case, NSH_USBCONDEV must
		be defined to indicate which USB device to use as the
		console.

config NSH_USBCONDEV
	string "USB console device"
	default "/dev/ttyACM0"
	depends on NSH_USBCONSOLE
	---help---
		If NSH_USBCONSOLE is set to 'y', then NSH_USBCONDEV must
		also be set to select the USB device used to support the
		NSH console.   This should be set to the quoted name of a
		readable/write-able USB driver such as:
		NSH_USBCONDEV="/dev/ttyACM0".

config USBDEV_MINOR
	int "USB console device minor number"
	default 0
	depends on NSH_USBCONSOLE
	---help---
		If there are more than one USB devices, then a USB device
		minor number may also need to be provided. Default: 0

comment "USB Trace Support"
config NSH_USBDEV_TRACE
	bool "Enable Builtin USB Trace Support"
	default n
	depends on USBDEV && (DEBUG || USBDEV_TRACE)
	---help---
		Enable builtin USB trace support in NSH.  If selected, buffered USB
		trace data will be presented each time a command is provided to NSH.
		The USB trace data will be sent to the console unless DEBUG set or
		unless you are using a USB console.  In those cases, the trace data
		will go to the SYSLOG device.

		If not enabled, the USB trace support can be provided by external
		logic such as apps/system/usbmonitor.

	bool "Default console device"
	default "/dev/console"
	depends on NSH_CONSOLE && !NSH_USBCONSOLE
	---help---
		If NSH_CONSOLE is set to 'y', then NSH_CONDEV
		may also be set to select the serial device used to support
		the NSH console.   This should be set to the quoted name of a
		readable/write-able character driver such as:
		NSH_CONDEV="/dev/ttyS1". This is useful, for example,
		to separate the NSH command line from the system console when
		the system console is used to provide debug output.  Default:
		stdin and stdout (probably "/dev/console")

		NOTE: When any other device other than /dev/console is used
		for a user interface, (1) linefeeds (\n) will not be expanded to
		carriage return / linefeeds (\r\n).  You will need to set
		your terminal program to account for this.  And (2) input is
		not automatically echoed so you will have to turn local echo on.

config NSH_ARCHINIT
	bool "Have architecture-specific initialization"
	default n
	---help---
		Set if your board provides architecture specific initialization
		via the board-specific function nsh_archinitialize().  This

		board logic to do such things as configure MMC/SD slots.

config NSH_TELNET
	bool "Use Telnet console"
	default n
	depends on NET && NET_TCP
	---help---
		If NSH_TELNET is set to 'y', then a TELENET

		you may log into NuttX remotely using telnet in order to
		access NSH.
