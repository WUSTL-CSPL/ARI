config EXAMPLES_OSTEST
	bool "OS test example"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the OS test example

if EXAMPLES_OSTEST

config EXAMPLES_OSTEST_LOOPS
	int "OS test loop"
	default 1
	---help---
		Used to control the number of executions of the test.  If undefined, the test
		executes one time.  If defined to be zero, the test runs forever.

config EXAMPLES_OSTEST_STACKSIZE
	int "OS test stack size"
	default 8192
	---help---
		Size of the stack used to create the ostest task.  Default is 8192.

config EXAMPLES_OSTEST_NBARRIER_THREADS
	int "Number of barrier threads"
	default 8
	---help---
		Specifies the number of threads to create in the barrier test.  The default
		is 8 but a smaller number may be needed on systems without sufficient memory
		to start so many threads.

config EXAMPLES_OSTEST_RR_RANGE
	int "Round-robin test - end of search range"
	default 10000
	range 1 32767
	---help---
		During round-robin scheduling test two threads are created. Each of the threads
		searches for prime numbers in the configurable range, doing that configurable
		number of times.

		This value specifies the end of search range and together with number of runs
		allows to configure the length of this test - it should last at least a few
		tens of seconds. Allowed values [1; 32767], default 10000

config EXAMPLES_OSTEST_RR_RUNS
	int "Round-robin test - number of runs"
	default 10
	range 1 32767
	---help---
		During round-robin scheduling test two threads are created. Each of the threads
		searches for prime numbers in the configurable range, doing that configurable
		number of times.

		This value specifies the number of times the thread searches the range for
		prime numbers and together with end of search range allows to configure the
		length of this test - it should last at least a few tens of seconds. Allowed
