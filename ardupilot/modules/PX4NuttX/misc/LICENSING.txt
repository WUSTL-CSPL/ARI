Licensing
^^^^^^^^^

This directory contains miscellaneous NuttX add-ons and utilities.
NuttX is retained separately for maintenance and licensing reasons.
NuttX has a BSD-style license.  However, the contents of this
directory have have other license restrictions.

The licensing of the components of this directory are summarized
below:

  buildroot:
    Description:  GNU toolchain build environment.  Derived from
      http://buildroot.uclibc.org/
    License: GPLv2

  pascal:
    Description:  Pascal compiler with NuttX runtime add-on.
    License: BSD

  sims:
    Description:  This is a repository of instruction set simulators
      that were used to verify NuttX.  The licensing of the
      instruction set simulators vary

    sims/z80sim:
      You are well comecom to use the source files provided in 
      this directory for any purpose.  However, the core of the Z80
      emulation is based on a proprietary-but-free-to-use
      instruction set emulator.  That emulation is not included
      in this directory, but is automatically downloaded when
      z80sim is built.

  drivers:
    Descriptions: This is a folder of drivers that are not included
    in the main NuttX source tree due to licensing or other concerns.
    Compatibly licensed drivers (BSD or MIT) are included in the main
    source tree.  These drivers have incompatible licesnes.  They
    may, as an example, have been leveraged from Linux and, hence,
    inherit a GPL license.  By installing this driver package you
    agree to the licensing terms of the individual drivers.

    rtl8187x
      This is a USB host driver for the RTL8187x wireless LAN.  Some
      of the critical logic in this driver derives from Linux and,
      hence, is GPLv2.
