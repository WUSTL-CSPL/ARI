	* Initial release

pascal-0.1.1 2008-02-01 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Correct some errors in the NuttX installation logic

pascal-0.1.2 2008-02-10 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Add logic to build and link with the ZDS-II toolchain
	  use with the z16f.
	* Make sure that POFF header structures are aligned
	* Standardized POFF file format to big-endian
	* Break up large switch statements to lower complexity
	  and eliminate a compiler bug
	* Changes so that runtime compiles with SDCC.

pascal-2.0 2009-12-21 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* Updated to use standard C99 types in stdint.h and
	  stdbool.h.  This change was necessary for compatibility
	  with NuttX-5.0 (any beyond).

pascal-3.0 2010-05-15 Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
	  apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-3.0 module is
	  incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the 
	  apps/ module was introduced.

pascal-3.1 2012-xx-xx Gregory Nutt <gnutt@nuttx.org>

	* nuttx/Makefile: If DIRLINK is defined, then INCDIR was not setup
	  correctly and the build failed.  The value of INCDIR must be
	  initialized unconditionally.
