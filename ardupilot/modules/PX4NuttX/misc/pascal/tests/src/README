Naming Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This directory contains miscellaneous Pascal test files.
All test fils are prefixed with a number.  The number is only to
control the order of execution:  From the most simple to the
most complex tests.

XXX-name.pas and (optional XXX-name.inp)

XXX-name.pas is the program under test XXX follows the numbering
conventions below.  'name' helps humans to remember what is
being testged.

XXX-name.inp contains optional inparameter for the program
under test.

General numbering conventions:

000-099: Basic functionality
100-199: Math and runtime libraries
200-299: Strings
500-599: multi-file features:  uses, units
800-899: Erie pascal programs
900-999: Misc. large programs not targeted at any particular feature.

Sources/Licensing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some of these pascal files were collected from the internet
and their original sources are lost to memory.  Since they are
included here only for testing purposes, I suspect that there
are no licensing issues... However, I would avoid using any of
these files as part of a pascal application!
