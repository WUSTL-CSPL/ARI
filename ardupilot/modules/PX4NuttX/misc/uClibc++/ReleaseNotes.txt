uClibc++-1.0
============

This package is a version of the uClibc++ C++ library customized to work
with NuttX.  This code originates from http://cxx.uclibc.org/ and has been
adapted for NuttX by the RGMP team (http://rgmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page).
Thanks go to Qiang Yu and David.

uClibc++ is released as a separate packet rather than being integrated with
the core NuttX source code. This separation is due to differences in
licensing betweein uClibc++ and NuttX:  NuttX is licensed under the
permissive modified BSD License; uClibc, on the other hand, is licensed
under the stricter GNU LGPL Version 3 license.

A simple installation script is provided at misc/uClibc++/install.sh that
can be used to install the uClibc++ components into the NuttX source tree.
See the README file in the top-level uClibc++ directory for instructions on
using the installation script.  If you wish to use uClibc++ with NuttX, you
will be required to comply with the licensing requires of the GNU LGPL
Version 3 license.

uClibc++ release 1.0 corresponds to SVN revision r5313.

Note that all SVN information has been stripped from the tarball.  If you
need the SVN configuration, you should check out directly from SVN.  Revision
r5313 should equivalent to release 1.0 of NuttX uClibc++:

    svn checkout -r5313 svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code

Or

    svn checkout -r5313 http://svn.code.sf.net/p/nuttx/code/trunk nuttx-code
