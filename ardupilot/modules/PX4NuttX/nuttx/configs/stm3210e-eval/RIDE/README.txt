README
------

This directory contains a simple RIDE7 project used to bring up the
STM3210E-EVAL board.  This project includes only the STM32 boot-up
code under arch/arm/src and configs/stm3210e-eval/src plus as little
additional environmental support as necessary.

bigfatstub.c

  The NuttX OS is not included in this project.  This file contains
  stubs for all of the NuttX entry points and this replaces NuttX

Make.defs, defconfig, setenv.h

  The first step to using this RIDE project is to build a compatible
  cygwin project.  This will set up of the directories and produce
  all of the necessary autogenerated files.

    cd tools
    ./configure.sh stm3210e-eva/RIDE
    cd ..
    . ./setenv.sh
    make

nuttx.*

  RIDE7 project files
  
../scripts/ld.scrip

  This is the linker script that replaces the RIDE7 linker script.

stm32-ld.sh

  This is a shell script that will use the RIDE7 tools to relink the
  NuttX binaries.  Useful because RIDE7 does not provide much linker
  output to see what is going on.
