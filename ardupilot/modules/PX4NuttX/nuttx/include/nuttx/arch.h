 *       the currently executing task, then again just modify
 *       the saved xcptcontext structure for the recipient
 *       task so it will invoke sigdeliver when that task is

/****************************************************************************
 * Name: up_romgetc
 *
 * Description:
 *   In Harvard architectures, data accesses and instruction accesses occur
 *   on different busses, perhaps concurrently.  All data accesses are
 *   performed on the data bus unless special  machine instructions are
 *   used to read data from the instruction address space.  Also, in the
 *   typical MCU, the available SRAM data memory is much smaller that the
 *   non-volatile FLASH instruction memory.  So if the application requires
 *   many constant strings, the only practical solution may be to store
 *   those constant strings in FLASH memory where they can only be accessed
 *   using architecture-specific machine instructions.
 *
 *   A similar case is where strings are retained in "external" memory such
 *   as EEPROM or serial FLASH.  This case is similar only in that again
 *   special operations are required to obtain the string data; it cannot
 *   be accessed directly from a string pointer.
 *
 *   If CONFIG_ARCH_ROMGETC is defined, then the architecture logic must
 *   export the function up_romgetc().  up_romgetc() will simply read one
 *   byte of data from the instruction space.
 *
 *   If CONFIG_ARCH_ROMGETC, certain C stdio functions are effected: (1)
 *   All format strings in printf, fprintf, sprintf, etc. are assumed to
 *   lie in FLASH (string arguments for %s are still assumed to reside in
 *   SRAM). And (2), the string argument to puts and fputs is assumed to
 *   reside in FLASH.  Clearly, these assumptions may have to modified for
 *   the particular needs of your environment.  There is no "one-size-fits-all"
 *   solution for this problem.
