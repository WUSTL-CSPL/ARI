  NuttX is a real timed embedded operating system (RTOS).

    <p>
      The goal is to provide implementations of most standard POSIX OS interfaces
      to support a rich, multi-threaded development environment for deeply embedded
      processors.
    </p>
      NON-GOALS: (1) It is not a goal to provide the level of OS features like those provided by Linux.
      In order to work with smaller MCUs, small footprint must be more important than an extensive feature set.
      But standard compliance is more important than small footprint.
      Surely a smaller RTOS could be produced by ignoring standards.
      Think of NuttX is a tiny Linux work-alike with a much reduced feature set.
      (2) There is no MMU-based support for processes.
      At present, NuttX assumes a flat address space.

    <p>
      Fully scalable from tiny (8-bit) to moderate embedded (32-bit).

      Many tiny source files, link from static libraries, highly configurable, use of
      weak symbols when available.

    <p>
      NuttX strives to achieve a high degree of standards compliance.
      The primary governing standards are POSIX and ANSI standards.
      Additional standard APIs from Unix and other common RTOS's are
      adopted for functionality not available under these standards
      or for functionality that is not appropriate for the deeply-embedded
      RTOS (such as <code>fork()</code>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of this standards conformance, software developed under other
      standard OSs (such as Linux) should port easily to NuttX.

  <b>Look at all those files and features... How can it be a tiny OS?</b>.
  The NuttX feature list (above) is fairly long and if you look at the NuttX
  source tree, you will see that there are hundreds of source files comprising
  NuttX.  How can NuttX be a tiny OS with all of that?

    <p>
      The philosophy behind that NuttX is that lots of features are great... <i>BUT</i>
      also that if you don't use those features, then you should not have to pay a penalty
      for the unused features.
      And, with NuttX, you don't!  If you don't use a feature, it will not
      be included in the final executable binary.
      You only have to pay the penalty of increased footprint for the features
      that you actually use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using a variety of technologies, NuttX can scale from the very tiny to
      the moderate-size system.  I have executed NuttX with some simple applications
      in as little as 32K <i>total</i> memory (code and data).
      On the other hand, typical, richly featured NuttX builds require more like 64K
      (and if all of the features are used, this can push 100K).

    <p>
      One may be intimidated by the size NuttX source tree.  There are hundreds of source files!
      How can that be a tiny OS?
      Actually, the large number of files is one of the tricks to keep NuttX small and
      as scalable as possible.
      Most files contain only a single function.
      Sometimes just one tiny function with only a few lines of code.
      Why?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Static Libraries</b>.
        Because in the NuttX build processed, objects are compiled and saved into
        <i>static libraries</i> (<i>archives</i>).
        Then, when the file executable is linked, only the object files that are needed
        are extracted from the archive and added to the final executable.
        By having many, many tiny source files, you can assure that no code that you do
        not execute is ever included in the link.
        And by having many, tiny source files you have better granularity --
        if you don't use that tiny function of even just a few lines of code, it will
        not be included in the binary.

    <b>Other Tricks</b>
  </td>

<tr>
  <td><br></td>
  <td>
    <p>
      As mentioned above, the use of many, tiny source files and linking from static
      libraries keeps the size of NuttX down.
      Other tricks used in NuttX include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
         <b>Configuration Files</b>.
         Before you build NuttX, you must provide a configuration file that specifies
         what features you plan to use and which features you do not.
         This configuration file contains a long list of settings that control
         what is built into NuttX and what is not.
         There are hundreds of such settings
         (see the <a href="NuttXConfigVariables.html">Configuration Variable Documentation</a>
         for a partial list that excludes platform specific settings).
         These many, many configuration options allow NuttX to be highly tuned to
         meet size requirements.
         The downside to all of these configuration options is that it greatly
         complicates the maintenance of NuttX -- but that is my problem, not yours.
      </li>
      <li>
         <b>Weak Symbols</b>
         The GNU toolchain supports <i>weak</i> symbols and these also help to keep
         the size of NuttX down.
         Weak symbols prevent object files from being drawn into the link even if they
         are accessed from source code.
         Careful use of weak symbols is another trick for keep unused code out of the
         final binary.

<h2>NuttX-6.27 Release Notes</h2>
<p>
  The 94<sup>th</sup> release of NuttX, Version 6.27, was made on April 28, 2013, and is available for download from the
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nuttx/files/">SourceForge</a> website.
  Note that the release consists of two tarballs:  <code>nuttx-6.27.tar.gz</code> and <code>apps-6.27.tar.gz</code>.
  Both may be needed (see the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for build information)
  The change log associated with the release is available <a href="#currentrelease">here</a>.
  Unreleased changes after this release are available in GIT.
  These unreleased changes are also listed <a href="#pendingchanges">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Additional new features and extended functionality</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>OS Initialization</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Add missing registration of <code>/dev/zero</code>.
        Registration of <code>/dev/null</code> should depend upon conditional compilation.
        From Ken Pettit.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Tasking</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added a new interface to set aside memory on the task's stack.
        This is used (at least in the kernel build) to hold task arguments.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove <code>up_assert_code()</code>.
        One assertion routine is enough.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Kernel Build</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Extensive changes were made to support the kernel build mode.
        In this mode, NuttX is built as a monolithic kernel.
        NuttX is built as a separate kernel mode &quot;blob&quot; and the applications are built as a separate user mode &quot;blob&quot;.
        The kernel runs in supervisor mode and the applications run in user mode (with the MPU restricting user mode accesses).
        Access to the kernel from the user blob is only via system calls (SVCalls in this case).
      </li>
      <li>
        Kernel build configurations for the Open1788 board and for the STM32F4Discovery now execute correctly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes were made to task and thread start-up routines, signal handling, data structures, ARMv7-M SVCalls, stack management interfaces,
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>

      </li>
      <li>
        Open1788:  Now supports SDRAM (used to provide the LCD framebuffer).
      </li>
      <li>

        That is much a better visual indication of the dynamic CPU load
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>LPC17xx Drivers</b>
    </p>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Directories where the same sources files are used to build different objects in the first and second pass kernel builds need to keep those objects in separate directories so that they are not constantly rebuilt.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Applications</b>
    </p>
    <ul>

  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Tools</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <b>Efforts In Progress</b>.
  The following are features that are partially implemented but present in this release.
  Most are expected to be fully available in NuttX 6.27.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Freescale Freedom KL25Z</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A port to the Freescale Freedom KL25Z is complete but not yet stable enough.
        The KL25Z is a low-cost Cortex-M0+ part with 128KB of FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
        This is is the effort of Alan Carvalho de Assis.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b><i>kconfig-frontends</i></b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Conversion of old configurations to use the <i>kconfig-frontends</i> tool is an ongoing effort that will continue for some time.
        At this time, only 32% of the configurations have been converted to use the kconfig-frontends tools.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>Bugfixes</b> (see the change log for details).
  Some of these are very important:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Tasking</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed a critical bug:
        When there is pending C buffered output and the system is very busy, the a pthread may be blocked at a critical point when trying to exit.
        Blocking at this critical point would cause crashes.
        All entire task/thread exit logic paths were reviewed and failsafe mechanisms were put in place to assure that exitting tasks never block after task teardown has been started.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>ARMv6-M (Cortex-M0/M0+)</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed parameter passing for all system call inline functions with &gt; 3 parameters
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a major problem:
        The Cortex-M0 has no BASEPRI register but thelogic of NuttX-6.26 was using it to manage interrupts.
        Switched to using the PRIMASK instead.
        This means that hardfaults will (again) occur when SVC instructions are executed
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>ARMv7-M (Cortex-M3/4)</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Corrected Correct MPU sub-region settings for unaligned regions.
      </li>
      <li>
        In exception handling with <code>CONFIG_NUTTX_KERNEL<.code>, need to explicitly set and clear the privilege bit in the <codee>CONTROL</code> register.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed parameter passing for all system call inline functions with &gt; 3 parameters
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Support for <code>O_NONBLOCK</code> was not supported in the &quot;upper half&quot; serial driver.
      </li>
      <li>
        PL2303 compilation errors
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Stellaris LM3S/4F</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Corrected typos in alternate function definitions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>LPC17xx Drivers</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added a work-around for an ADC errata.
        From Chris Taglia
      </li>
      <li>
        Only one ADC pin was configured.
        Need to configure all that are in the ADC0 set.

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>File Systems</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The FAT logic was not making a distinction between directory non-existence and file non-existence so when it you try to create a file in a non-existent directory; it would create a file with the name of the missing directory.
        Reported by Andrew Tridgell
      </li>
      <li>
        Several fixes to the FAT file system from Ronen Vainish.
        These fixes mostly involve the logic to extend directory clusters for the case of long file names but also include a few important general fixes (such as for storing 32 bit FAT values)
      </li>
      <li>
        <code>mkfatfs</code> was writing the boot code to the wrong location.
        From Petteri Aimonen
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <b>Networking</b>
    </p>
    <ul>

          The basic EA3131 port is complete and verified in NuttX-5.2
          This basic port includes basic boot-up, serial console, and timer interrupts.
          This port was extended in NuttX 5.3 with a USB high speed driver contributed by David Hewson.
          David also contributed I2C and SPI drivers plus several important LPC313x USB bug fixes
          that appear in the NuttX 5.6 release.
          This port has been verified using the NuttX OS test, USB serial and mass storage
          tests and includes a working implementation of the NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
          Support for <a href="NuttXDemandPaging.html">on-demand paging</a> has been developed for the EA3131.
      That support would all execute of a program in SPI FLASH by paging code sections out of SPI flash as needed.
      However, as of this writing, I have not had the opportunity to verify this new feature.

      <p>
        <b>STATUS:</b>
          Basic support is in place for both the LPC3152 MCU and the EA3152 board.
          Verification of the port was deferred due to tool issues
          However, because of the high degree of compatibility between the LPC313x and LPC315x family, it
          is very likely that the support is in place (or at least very close).
          At this point, verification of the EA3152 port has been overcome by events and
          may never happen.
          However, the port is available for anyone who may want to use it.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS</b>.
        Initial support for the NUC120 was released in NuttX-6.26.
        This initial support is very minimal:
        There is an OS test configuration that verifies the correct port of NuttX to the part and
        a NuttShell (<a href="NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configuration that might be the basis for an application development.
        As of this writing, more device drivers are needed to make this a more complete port.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        For a full-featured RTOS such as NuttX, providing support in a usable and meaningful way within the tiny memories of the NUC120 demonstrates the scalability of NuttX.  The NUC120LE2AN comes in a 48-pin package and has 128KB FLASH and 16KB of SRAM.
        When running the NSH configuration (itself a full up application), there is still more than 90KB of FLASH and 10KB or SRAM available for further application development).
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  35037     106    1092   36235    8d8b nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 34.2KB of FLASH leaving 93.8KB of FLASH (72%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 1.2KB (&lt;4%) and leaves 14.8KB (86%) available for heap at runtime.
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>

    <ul>
      <p>
        The STM32L-Discovery and 32L152CDISCOVERY kits are functionally equivalent.
        The difference is the internal Flash memory size (STM32L152RBT6 with 128 Kbytes or STM32L152RCT6 with 256 Kbytes).

    </p>
    <ul>
      <p>
        <b>STATUS:</b>
        The basic SAM3U-EK port was released in NuttX version 5.1. The basic port includes boot-up
        logic, interrupt driven serial console, and system timer interrupts.
        That release passes the NuttX OS test and is proven to have a valid OS implementation.
        A configuration to support the NuttShell is also included.
        NuttX version 5.4 adds support for the HX8347 LCD on the SAM3U-EK board.
        This LCD support includes an example using the
        <a href=" http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NXGraphicsSubsystem.html">NX graphics system</a>.
        NuttX version 6.10 adds SPI support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subsequent NuttX releases will extend this port and add support for SDIO-based SD cards and
        USB device (and possible LCD support).
        These extensions may or may not happen soon as my plate is kind of full now.

      The port of NuttX to the WaveShare Open1788 is a collaborative effort between Rommel Marcelo and myself
      (with Rommel being the leading contributor and I claiming only a support role).
      You can get more information at the Open1788 board from the WaveShare <a href="http://www.wvshare.com/product/Open1788-Standard.htm">website</a>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      Initial Open1788 support appeared in NuttX-6.26 with the first verified configurations in NuttX-6.27.
      In NuttX-6.27 there is a working basic port with OS verification, Nuttshell (<a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH</a>) configurations, and a graphics test configuration.
      SDRAM and GPDMA are working.
      The NSH configuration includes verfied support for a DMA-based SD card interface.
      The frame-buffer LCD driver is functional and uses the SDRAM for frame-buffer memory.
      A touchscreen interface has been developed but there appears to be a hardware issue with the WaveShare implementation of the XPT2046 touchscreen controller.

      This NuttX port is for the LPC4330-Xplorer board from NGX Technologies featuring the NXP LPC4330FET100 MCU.
      See the <a href="http://shop.ngxtechnologies.com/product_info.php?cPath=21_37&products_id=104">NXG website</a> for further information about this board.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.20</b>
          The basic port is complete.
          The OS test configuration and the basic NSH configurations are present and fully verified.
          This includes verified support for:  SYSTICK system time,  pin and GPIO configuration, and a serial console.
        </p>
        <p>
          Several drivers have been copied from the related LPC17xx port but require integration into the LPC43xx:  ADC, DAC, GPDMA, I2C, SPI, and SSP.
          The registers for these blocks are the same in both the LPC43xx and the LPC17xx and they should integrate into the LPC43xx very easily by simply adapting the clocking and pin configuration logic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other LPC17xx drivers were not brought into the LPC43xx port because these peripherals have been completely redesigned:  CAN, Ethernet, USB device, and USB host.
        </p>
        <p>
          So then there is no support for the following LPC43xx peripherals: SD/MMC, EMC, USB0,USB1, Ethernet, LCD, SCT, Timers 0-3, MCPWM, QEI, Alarm timer, WWDT, RTC, Event monitor, and CAN.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these can be leveraged from other MCUs that appear to support the same peripheral IP:
          <ul>
            <li>
              The LPC43xx USB0 peripheral appears to be the same as the USB OTG peripheral for the LPC31xx.
              The LPC31xx USB0 device-side driver has been copied from the LPC31xx port but also integration into the LPC43xx (clocking and pin configuration).
              It should be possible to complete poriting of this LPC31xx driver with a small porting effort.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Ethernet block looks to be based on the same IP as the STM32 Ethernet and, as a result, it should be possible to leverage the NuttX STM32 Ethernet driver with a little more effort.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>NuttX-6.21</b>
        Added support for a SPIFI block driver and for RS-485 option to the serial driver.

        <b>Memory Usage</b>.
        The ATSAM4LC4C comes in a 100-pin package and has 256KB FLASH and 32KB of SRAM.
        Below is the current memory usage for the NSH configuration (June 9, 2013).
        This is <i>not</i> a minimal implementation, but a full-featured NSH configuration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Static memory usage can be shown with <code>size</code> command:
      </p>
      <ul><pre>
$ size nuttx
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  43572     122    2380   46074    b3fa nuttx
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        NuttX, the NSH application, and GCC libraries use 42.6KB of FLASH leaving 213.4B of FLASH (83.4%) free from additional application development.
        Static SRAM usage is about 2.3KB (&lt;7%) and leaves 29.7KB (92.7%) available for heap at runtime.
      </p>
        SRAM usage at run-time can be shown with the NSH <code>free</code> command.
        This runtime memory usage includes the static memory usage <i>plus</i> all dynamic memory allocation for things like stacks and I/O buffers:
      <ul><pre>
NuttShell (NSH) NuttX-6.28
nsh> free
             total       used       free    largest
Mem:         29232       5920      23312      23312
</pre></ul>
    <p>
      You can see that 22.8KB (71.1%) of the SRAM heap is staill available for further application development while NSH is running.

    <p><b>AVR-Specific Issues</b>.
      The basic AVR port is solid and biggest issue for using AVR is its tiny SRAM memory and its Harvard architecture.
      Because of the Harvard architecture, constant data that resides to flash is inaccessible using &quot;normal&quot; memory reads and writes (only SRAM data can be accessed &quot;normally&quot;).
      Special AVR instructions are available for accessing data in FLASH, but these have not been integrated into the normal, general purpose OS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most NuttX test applications are console-oriented with lots of strings used for printf and debug output.
      These strings are all stored in SRAM now due to these data accessing issues and even the smallest console-oriented applications can quickly fill a 4-8K memory.
      So, in order for the AVR port to be useful, one of two things would need to be done:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Don't use console applications that required lots of strings.
        The basic AVR port is solid and your typical deeply embedded application should work fine.
        Or,
      </li>
      <li>
        Create a special version of printf that knows how to access strings that reside in FLASH (or EEPROM).

          There is a good chance that the NSH port is complete and functional, but I am not yet able to demonstrate that.
          At present, I get nothing coming in the serial RXD line (probably because the pins are configured wrong or I have the MAX232 connected wrong).

        See the <a href="http://www.sureelectronics.net/goods.php?id=1168">Sure website</a> for further information about the DB-DP11215 board.
        (I believe that that the DB-DP11215 may be obsoleted now but replaced with the very similar, DB-DP11212.
        The DB-DP11212 board differs, I believe, only in its serial port configuration.)

       <b>STATUS:</b>
       This NuttX port is code complete and has considerable test testing.
       The port for this board was completed in NuttX 6.11, but still required a few bug fixes before it will be ready for prime time.
       The fully verified port first appeared in NuttX 6.13.
       Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
       An untested USB device-side driver is available in the source tree.
       A more complete port would include support of the USB OTG port and of the LCD display on this board.
       Those drivers are not yet available as of this writing.

     There one two board ports using this chip:
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li><b>PIC32MX Board from PCB Logic Design Co</b>.
      This port is for the PIC32MX board from PCB Logic Design Co. and used the PIC32MX460F512L.
      The board is a very simple -- little more than a carrier for the PIC32 MCU plus voltage regulation, debug interface, and an OTG connector.
    </li>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      The basic port is code complete and fully verified in NuttX 6.13.
      Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
    </p>
    <li><b>UBW32 Board from Sparkfun</b>
      This is the port to the Sparkfun UBW32 board.
      This port uses the <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8971">original v2.5</a> board which is based on the MicroChip PIC32MX460F512L.
      This older version has been replaced with this <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/9713">newer board</a>.
      See also the <a href="http://www.schmalzhaus.com/UBW32/">UBW32</a> web site.
    </li>
    <p>
      <b>STATUS:</b>
      The basic port is code complete and fully verified in NuttX 6.18.
      Available configurations include the OS test and the NuttShell (NSH - see the <a href="http://www.nuttx.org/Documentation/NuttShell.html">NSH User Guide</a>).
      USB has not yet been fully tested but on first pass appears to be functional.

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Microchip PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit</b>.
         This port uses the Microchip PIC32 Ethernet Starter Kit (DM320004) with the Expansion I/O board.
         See the <a href="http://ww.microchip.com">Microchip website</a> for further information.
      </li>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         This port was started and then shelved for some time until I received the Expansion I/O board.
         The basic Starter Kit (even with the Multimedia Expansion Board, MEB, DM320005)) has no serial port and most NuttX test configurations depend heavily on console output.
      </p>
      <p>
         Verified configurations for the OS test and the NuttShel (NSH) appeared in NuttX-6.16.
         Board support includes a verified USB (device-side) driver.
         Also included are a a verified Ethernet driver, a partially verified USB device controller driver, and an unverifed SPI driver.

        A port has been completed for the  Mikroelektronika PIC32MX7 Multimedia Board (MMB).
        See http://www.mikroe.com/ for further information about this board.
      </li>
      <p>
       <b>STATUS:</b>
         Two verified configurations are available:
         (1) The basic OS test configuration that verfies the correctness port of NuttX, and (2) an extensive <a href="NuttShell.html">NuttShell (NSH)</a> configuration.
         The NSH configuration includes:
         (1) Full network support,
         (2) Verified SPI driver,
         (3) SPI-based SD Card support,
         (4) USB device support (including configuration options for the USB mass storage device and the CDC/ACM serial class), and
         (5) Support for the MIO873QT2 LCD on the PIC32MX7 MMB.
       </p>
       </p>
         The PIC32MX7 MMB's touchscreen is connected directly to the MCU via ADC pins.
         A touchscreen driver has been developed using the PIC32's ADC capabilities and can be enabled in the NSH configuration.
         However, additional verification and tuning of this driver is required.
         Further display/touchscreen verification would require C++ support (for NxWidgets and NxWM).
         Since I there is no PIC32 C++ is the free version of the MPLAB C32 toolchain, further graphics development is stalled.

        that certain SH-1 instructions stop working as advertised.  This could be a silicon
        problem, some pipeline issue that is not handled properly by the gcc 3.4.5 toolchain

    <p>
      This is a tougher environment.
      In this case, the Windows native toolchain is unaware of the
      Cygwin <i>sandbox</i> and, instead, operates in the native Windows environment.
      The primary difficulties with this are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Paths</b>.
        Full paths for the native toolchain must follow Windows standards.
        For example, the path <code>/home/my\ name/nuttx/include</code> my have to be
        converted to something like <code>'C:\cygwin\home\my name\nuttx\include'</code>
        to be usable by the toolchain.
      </li>
      <p>
        Fortunately, this conversion is done simply using the <code>cygpath</code> utility.
      </p>
      <li>
        <b>Symbolic Links</b>
        NuttX depends on symbolic links to install platform-specific directories in the build system.
        On Linux, true symbolic links are used.
        On Cygwin, emulated symbolic links are used.
        Unfortunately, for native Windows applications that operate outside of the
        Cygwin <i>sandbox</i>, these symbolic links cannot be used.
      </li>
      <p>
        The NuttX make system works around this limitation by copying the platform
        specific directories in place.
        These copied directories make work a little more complex, but otherwise work well.
      </p>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: In this environment, it should be possible to use the NTFS <code>mklink</code> command to create links.
        This should only require a minor modification to the build scripts (see <code>tools/copydir.sh</code> script).
      </small></p>
      <li>
        <b>Dependencies</b>
        NuttX uses the GCC compiler's <code>-M</code> option to generate make dependencies.  These
        dependencies are retained in files called <code>Make.deps</code> throughout the system.
        For compilers other than GCC, there is no support for making dependencies in this way.
        For Windows native GCC compilers, the generated dependencies are windows paths and not
        directly usable in the Cygwin make.  By default, dependencies are surpressed for these
        compilers as well.
      </li>
      <p><small>
        NOTE: dependencies are suppress by setting the make variable <code>MKDEPS</code> to point
        to the do-nothing dependency script, <code>tools/mknulldeps.sh</code>.
      </small></p>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <b>Supported Windows Native Toolchains</b>.
      At present, the following Windows native toolchains are in use:
      <ol>
        <li>GCC built for Windows (such as CodeSourcery, Atollic, devkitARM, etc.),</li>

    <p>
      This capability first appeared in NuttX-6.24 and should still be considered a work in progress because: (1) it has not been verfied on all targets and tools, and (2) still lacks some of the creature-comforts of the more mature environments.
      The windows native build logic initiatiated if <code>CONFIG_WINDOWS_NATIVE=y</code> is defined in the NuttX configuration file:

    <p>
      At present, this build environment also requires:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Windows Console</b>.
        The build must be performed in a Windows console window.
        This may be using the standard <code>CMD.exe</code> terminal that comes with Windows.
        I prefer the ConEmu terminal which can be downloaded from:
        http://code.google.com/p/conemu-maximus5/
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>GNUWin32</b>.
        The build still relies on some Unix-like commands.
        I usethe GNUWin32 tools that can be downloaded from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/.
        See the top-level <code>nuttx/README.txt</code> file for some download, build, and installation notes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>MinGW-GCC</b>.
        MinGW-GCC is used to compiler the C tools in the <code>nuttx/tools</code> directory that are neede by the build.
        MinGW-GCC can be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org/.
        If you are using GNUWin32, then it is recommendedthe you not install the optional MSYS components as there may be conflicts.

      I've never tried this one, but I off the following reported by an ez80 user using the ZiLOG ZDS-II Windows-native toolchain:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
         &quot;I've installed ZDS-II 5.1.1 (IDE for ez80-based boards) on wine (windows emulator for UNIX) and to my surprise, not many changes were needed to make GIT snapshot of NuttX buildable...
         I've tried nsh profile and build process completed successfully.
         One remark is necessary: NuttX makefiles for ez80 are referencing <code>cygpath</code> utility.
         Wine provides similar thing called <code>winepath</code> which is compatible and offers compatible syntax.
         To use that, <code>winepath</code> (which itself is a shell script) has to be copied as <code>cygpath</code> somewhere in <code>$PATH</code>, and edited as in following patch:
       </p>
       <ul><pre>
# diff -u `which winepath` `which cygpath`
--- /usr/bin/winepath 2011-05-02 16:00:40.000000000 +0200

#

# determine the app Winelib library name
-appname=`basename "$0" .exe`.exe
+appname=winepath.exe

# first try explicit WINELOADER
if [ -x "$WINELOADER" ]; then exec "$WINELOADER" "$appname" "$@"; fi
</pre></ul>
      <p>
        &quot;Better solution would be replacing all <code>cygpath</code> references in  <code>Makefiles </code> with  <code>$(CONVPATH)</code> (or  <code>${CONVPATH}</code> in shell scripts) and setting <code>CONVPATH</code> to  <code>cygpath</code> or  <code>winepath</code> regarding to currently used environment.

    <p>
      <b>Environment Dependencies</b>.
      The primary environmental dependency of NuttX are (1) GNU make,
      (2) bash scripting, and (3) Linux utilities (such as cat, sed, etc.).
      If you have other platforms that support GNU make or make
      utilities that are compatible with GNU make, then it is very
      likely that NuttX would work in that environment as well (with some
      porting effort). If GNU make is not supported, then some significant
      modification of the Make system would be required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>MSYS</b>.
      I have not used MSYS but what I gather from talking with NuttX users is that MSYS can be used as an alternative to Cygwin in any of the above Cygwin environments.
      This is not surprising since MSYS is based on an older version of Cygwin (cygwin-1.3).
      MSYS has been modified, however, to interoperate in the Windows environment better than Cygwin and that may be of value to some users.
    </p>
    <p>
      MSYS, however, cannot be used with the native Windows NuttX build because it will invoke the MSYS bash shell instead of the <code>CMD.exe</code> shell.
      Use GNUWin32 in the native Windows build envionment.

6.27 2013-04-28 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_mpu.c:  Correct MPU sub-region settings for
      unaligned regions (2013-03-15).
    * arch/arm/src/armv6-m/up_svcall.c:  Bring up to equivalent to the
      ARMv7-M version (2013-03-15).
    * configs/lm4f120-launchpad/tools:  Add scripts and instructions to
      simplify use of OpenOCD with ICDI (from JP Carballo, 2013-03-15).
    * tools/mkconfig.c:  Logic that attempts to suppress buffered I/O
      within the kernel is wrong.  sizeof(struct file_struct) must be
      the same in both kernel- and user-spaces (2013-03-16).
    * arch/arm/src/common/up_pthread_start.c, libc/pthread/pthread_startup.c,
      and related files:  Implement switch to user-space and user-space
      pthread start-up function (2013-03-16).
    * arch/arm/src/common/up_signal_handler.c, libc/pthread/pthread_startup.c,
      and related files:  Implement switch to user-space and user-space
      pthread start-up function (2013-03-16).
    * arch/arm/src/common/up_signal_handler.c, libc/signal/signal_handler.c,
      arch/arm/src/armv[6|7]-m/up_svcall.c, arch/arm/include/armv[6|7]-m/svcall.h,
      include/nuttx/userspace.h, and sched/sig_deliver.c:  Implement switch
      to user-space from kernel signal delivery trampoline before calling user-
      space signal handler.  Return from user-space signal handler using a
      system call (2013-03-16).
    * arch/arm/src/armv[6|7]-m/up_schedulesigaction.c: Need make sure we are
      in kernel mode before switching to kernel-mode signal handler
      trampoline (2013-03-16).
    * arch/arm/include/armv[6|7]-m/irq.h, and arch/arm/src/armv[6|7]-m/up_svcall.c:
      Add support for nested system calls.  In the current design, this can
      happen only under one condition:  When the kernel system call logic calls
      back into user space in order to allocate user space memory.  So it is
      expected that the maximum nesting level will be only 2 (2013-03-17).
    * libc/stdio/lib_sccanf.c:  Correct an error in sscanf.  If %n occurs in
      the format statement after the input data stream has been fully
      parsed, the %n format specifier will not be handled.  Reported by
      Lorenz Meier (and also earlier by Kate) (2013-03-17).
    * drivers/serial/serial.c:  Support for O_NONBLOCK was not supported
      in the &quot;upper half&quot; serial driver.  This is normally not an issue
      because UART TX is almost always available, but it does become an
      if the UART uses hardware flow control or if the a &quot;lower half&quot; is
      something like the USB CDC/ACM driver that may need to block for
      significant amounts of time (2013-03-18).
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-h/ram_vectors.h, up_ramvec_*.c, arch/arm/src/*/*_irq.c,
      and Make.defs:  Add support for modifiable interrupt vectors in RAM
      (2013-03-18).
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_exception.S, sam3u/sam3u_vectors.S, and
      lpc17xx/lpc17_vectors.S: In exception handling with CONFIG_NUTTX_KERNEL,
      need to explicitly set and clear the privilege bit in the CONTROL
      register on return.  I assumed this would be handled automatically
      by the EXC_RETURN.  Silly me (2013-03-18).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17_adc.c:  Add a work-around for an ADC errata.  From
      Chris Taglia (2013-3-19).
    * arch/arm/src/armv7-m/up_hardfault.c:  If the PRIMASK is used to disable
      interrupts, then additional logic is required in the hard fault handler
      (2013-3-19).
    * libc/ and mm/: Directories where the same sources files are used to
      build different objects in the first and second pass kernel builds need
      to keep those objects in separate directories so that they are not
      constantly rebuilt (2013-3-19).
    * fs/fat:  Create an error in FAT file creation.  The FAT logic was
      not making a distinction between directory non-existence and file
      non-existence so when it you try to create a file in a non-existent
      directory, it would create a file with the name of the missing
      directory.  Reported by Andrew Tridgell (2013-03-30).
    * Numerous files:  Changed the protoypes of up_create_stack() and
      up_release_stack() so that is includes a task type.  Normally you
      can get this type from the TCB parameter, but there are certain
      conditions when the task type is not valid in the TCB when these
      functions are called.  Only the prototypes were changed on this
      big, initial checkin.  The next step will be to add logic to
      allocate stacks for kernel threads from protected kernel memory
      and all other task types from unprotected user memory (2013-03-20).
    * arch/*/src/common/up_createstack.c, up_use_stack.c, and
      up_release_stack.c:  If creating or releasing the stack for a kernel
      thread, use the kernel allocator so that the kernel thread stacks
      are protected from user application meddling (2013-03-20).
    * arch/arm/src/armv[6|7]-m/up_scall.c:  Fix parameter passing for
      all system call inline functions with &gt; 3 parameters (2013-03-20)
    * arch/*/src/common/up_stackframe.c and include/nuttx/arch.h:  Add
      and new interface to set aside memory on the stack.  This will be
      used at least in the kernel build to hold task arguments (2013-03-21).
    * sched/sig_deliver.c:  When dispatching signals to user threads,
      copy the siginfo_t from the sigq to the stack.  The signal queue
      is allocated from kernel memory; however, the current stack is
      the user's stack and the user code will be able to access the
      signinfo_t data from the stack copy (2013-03-21).
    * arch/arm/src/stm32:  Added support for the kernel mode build
      (cloned from the lpc17xx).  (2013-03-21).
    * configs/stme32f4discovery/kernel and scripts:  Add support for
      the kernel mode build on the STM32F4Discovery  (2013-03-21).
    * drivers/st7567.c/h and include/nuttx/lcd/st7567.h:  Driver for
      the ST7567 LCD Display Module from Univision Technology Inc.
      contributed by Manikandan.S (2013-03-22).
    * configs/zkit-arm-1769:  Now supports the ST7567 LCD display
      module.  Added an nxhello configuration for testing (Manikandan.S,
      2013-03-22).
    * configs/stm32f4discovery/kostest:  Add a kernel mode version
      of the OS test for the STM32F4Discovery board (2013-03-22).
    * nuttx/include/nuttx,  nuttx/configs/sam3u-ek, nuttx/configs/open1788,
      nuttx/configs/stm32f4discovery, and nuttx/arch/arm:  Complete
      re-archtecting of how signals are dispatched to user-space code
      in the kernel build.  The original implementation was C-based
      and simpler.  However, the C code intermixed with SVC calls was
      not properly preserving registers.  The more complex, assembly
      language version does not suffer from these issues.  I believe
      the the kernel build can now be called &quot;feature complete&quot;
      (2013-03-23).
    * binfmt/binfmt_execmodule.c:  Here is a place where I forget
      to update the call to sched_releasetcb() to pass the thread
      type as the second parameter (2013-03-23).
    * arch/arm/src/lm, kinetis, lpc32, and nuc1xx:  Add kernel build
      support to all ARMv7-M and ARMv6-M chips.  There are no
      configurations in place to to verify these additions!
      (2013-03-24).
    * arch/arm/src/lm/lm_gpio.h:  Correct typos in alternate function
      definitions (2013-03-24).
    * arch/arm/src/lm/lm_lowputc.c and lm_serial.c:  Add support for
      the 7 UARTs on the LM4F120 (2013-03-24).
    * configs/lm4f120-launchpad/ostest/defconfig:  Fix the configured
      RAM size.  This appears to be the last show-stopper bug:  The
      LaunchPad now runs NuttX!  (2013-03-24).
    * configs/lm4f120-launchpad/nsh:  Add an NSH configuration for the
      LaunchPad (2013-03-24).
    * configs/kwikstik-k40:  Converted configurations to use the
      konfig-frontends tool (2013-03-25).
    * configs/twr-k60n512:  Converted configurations to use the
      konfig-frontends tool (2013-03-25).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_lcd.c:  Add an LCD framebuffer driver
      for the LPC177x/8x family (2103-3-26).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_emc.c and
      configs/open1788/src/lpc17_sdraminitialize.c:  Began testing the
      Open1788 SDRAM.  The SDRAM is basically functional, but there are
      failures with the SDRAM is stressed by the memory test at
      apps/example/ramtest (SDRAM support and the RAM test can be configured
      into the base configs/open1788/nsh configuration as described in
      configs/open1788/READMT.txt (2103-3-27).
    * configs/open1788/nxlines:  Add a configuration to test both the
      Open1788 LCD and SDRAM which is used as a framebuffer (2013-3-27).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gdma.c and lpc17_sdcard.c:  Began
      implementation of the LPC17 DMA and integration into the SDCARD
      driver (2013-3-29).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gdma.c: LPC17 DMA is code complete and
      under test.  Does not yet work (2013-3-30).
    * fs/fat/fs_fat32dirent.c and fs_fat32util.c:  Several fixes to the
      FAT file system from Ronen Vainish.  These fixes mostly involve the
      logic to extend directory clusters for the case of long file names
      but also include a few important general fixes (such as for storing
      32 bit FAT values) (2013-03-31).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gdma.c and lpc17_sdcard.c:  SD card DMA
      is now functional.  Thre may be some issues with DMA from CPU SRAM
      which is apparently disabled in sleep mode; up_idle() always enters
      sleep mode (2013-03-31).
    * arch/arm/src/stm32:  Add architecure support for the STM32 F427/F437
      chips. Contributed by Mike Smith (2013-4-01).
    * configs/zkit-arm-1769/src/up_can.c:  Add support for both CAN1
      and CAN2.  Contributed by M.Kannan (2013-4-01).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_spi.c and lpc17_ssp.c and
      configs/olimex-lpc1766stk, nucleus2g, zkit-arm-1769, and
      lpcxpresso-lpc1768:  The initialization function for both the LPC17xx
      SPI and SSP blocks was called up_spinitialize() which is the common API
      definition of include/nuttx/spi.h.  But this raises a problem when the
      MCU has multiple blocks for differ SPI implementations as does the
      LPC17xx (and also as does other architectures like STM32 that have
      USARTs that can serve as SPI interfaces as well).  These were renamed
      to lpc17_spiinitialize() and lpc17_sspinitialize() in this case.
      Problem reported by M. Kannan (2013-4-01).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpdma.c and lpc17_idle.c:  In sleep mode,
      DMA can only be performed from peripheral SRAM.  CPU SRAM is shutdown
      in sleep mode.  In order to simplify DMA memory allocation, the LPC17xx
      IDLE will now hold off going to sleep mode if there is a DMA in progress
     (2013-4-01).
    * configs/open1788/src/lpc17_autoleds.c:  Reversed sense of the IDLE LCD.
      It is now off when the LPC17 is sleeping and on when awake.  That is
      much more useful because it provides a good visual indication of the
      dynamic CPU load (2013-4-01).
    * configs/open1788/src/lpc17_touchscreen.c and lpc17_ssp.c:  Add
      support for the touschscreen on the WaveShare LCD (2013-4-01).
    * configs/several:  There were already some functions called
      lpc17_sspinitialize().  So they had to be renamed (2013-4-01).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_ssp.c:  Adapted to work the the LPC178x
      family (2013-4-01).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpio.c/.h:  Separate LPC176x and LPC178x
      logic into separate files.  The logic is diverging to much to
      try to retain common code (2013-4-03).
    * net/net_clone.c:  Fix compilation error when socket options are
      are disabled. Reported by Daniel O'Connor (2013-4-05).
    * configs/zkit-arm-1769/src/up_leds.c:  Fix a typo introduced into
      the button interrupt logic (2013-4-05).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc178x_gpio.c:  Re-design of the GPIO
      logic for the LPC178x family by Rommel Marcelo (2013-4-05).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17_gpiodbg.c:  Updated so that it correctly
      reports LPC177x/8x GPIO registers when GPIO debug is enabled
      (2013-4-05).
    * arch/arm/src/Makefile:  The variable NUTTX already includes
      the extension $(EXEEXT).  So remove the second extension
      $(NUTTX)$(EXEEXT) in two places (2013-4-7).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_gpioint.c:  Disable interrrupts in
      lpc17_setintedge().  This logic must be atomic because it can be
      re-entered before it completes enabled interrupts, sometimes
      leaving the interrupts in a strange state (2013-4-7).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17_lcd.c:  Rommel Marcelo got the LPC1788
      framebuffer-based LCD working.  Very nice! (2013-4-08).
    * arch/arm/src/lm/lm_clockconfig.c and configs/lm4f120-launchpad:
      Fix handling of the RCC SYSDIV2 field whent the PLL output is
      400MHz.  Don't forget to set the USERCC2 bit in the register or
      all is for naught (2013-4-09).
    * configs/zkit-arm-1769/src/up_lcd.c, up_ssp.c, and up_spi.c:
      Use SSP0 to LCD and SPI to SD-Card on the Zkit-arm-1769 board.
      From Manikandan. S (2013-4-10)
    * configs/olimex-lpc1766stk/usbserial:  Converted to use the
      kconfig-config frontends tools (2013-4-12).
    * drivers/usbdev/pl2303.c: Fix some compilation errors that
      crept in when fixes to the CDC/ACM driver where blindly
      incorporated in the PL2303 driver (2013-4-12).
    * configs/stm3210e-eval/usbserial:  Converted to use the
      kconfig-config frontends tools (2013-4-12).
    * configs/nucleus2g/usbserial:  Converted to use the
      kconfig-config frontends tools (2013-4-12).
    * arch/arm/src/kl and arch/arm/include/kl:  Add support for the
      Kinetis L family of Cortex-M0+ MCUs.  Contributed by Alan
      Carvalho de Assis.  NOTE:  This is still very much a work in
      progress as of this initial commit (2013-04-16).
    * configs/freedom-kl25z:  Support for the Freedom KL25Z board
      contributed by Alan Carvalho de Assis.  NOTE:  This is still
      very much a work inprogress as of this initial commit
      (2013-04-16).
    * arm/arm/src/armv6-m and arch/arm/include/armv6-m:  Ooops.  Fix
      a major screw-up:  The Cortex-M0 has no BASEPRI register but
      the current logic was using it to manage interrupts.  Switch
      to using the PRIMASK.  This means that hardfaults will (again)
      occur when SVC instructions are executed (2013-4-16).
    * configs/stm3240g-eval/ostest:  Converted to use the kconfig-frontends
      tools (2013-4-17).
    * sched/task_exithook.c:  Don't flush the streams until the
      final thread of the group exits.  Flushing may cause the
      thread to get suspended at a bad time and other threads in the
      group may run while the exiting thread is in an unhealthy state.
      This can cause crashes under certain circumstance.  This is a
      critical bugfix (2013-4-18).
    * drivers/mtd/ramtron.c:  Extended to support the FM25V01 device.
      Contributed by Lorenz Meier (2013-4-18).
    * sched/task_deletecurrent.c and task_exit.c, arch/*/up_exit.c:
      Renamed task_deletecurrent() and task_exit() since it really
      handles the architecture independent part of _exit().  _exit()
      is used internally, but if it is called from the user, it should
      unregister any atexit() or on_exit() functions (2013-4-18).
    * tools/kconfig2html.c: This is the beginning of a tool to
      replace the hand-generated documentation of the NuttX configruation
      variables with auto-generated documentation.  The initial checkin
      is an incomplete, poorly structured prototype that I hope to
      evolve into a useful tool (2014-4-20).
    * libc/string/lib_strchr.c:  strchr(str, '\0') should return a
      pointer to the end of the string, not NULL.  From Petteri
      Aimonen (2014-4-22).
    * fs/fat/fs_writefat.c: mkfatfs was writing the boot code to the
      wrong location.  From Petteri Aimonen (2014-4-22).
    * Documentation:  The NuttX documentation now expects to find an
      auto-generated version of the configuration variable documentation
      at Documentation/NuttXConfigVariables.html (2014-4-22).
    * arch/arm/src/lpc17xx/lpc17_adc.c:  Only one ADC pin was configured.
      Need to configure all that are in the ADC0 set.  From MKannan
      (2014-4-23).
    * configs/zkit-arm-1769/src:  ADC and SPI/USB MSC updates from
      MKannan (2014-4-23).
    * arm/src/armv7-m/ram_vectors.h and arm/src/armv7-m/up_ramvec_initialize.c:
      Fixes to RAM vector logic from Paul Y. Zhang (2014-4-23)
    * tools/kconfig2html.c:  Improve behavior of Expand/Collapse
      Table of Contents; Handle errors in parsing of strings and in
      some uninitialized variables.  Add an option to use jQuery.
    * tools/mkconfigvar.sh: Fix make target (2014-4-23).
    * sched/exit.c, pthread_exit.c, task_exit.c, task_delete,c and
      task_exithook.c:  For pthread_exit(), move some logic to an early
      point in the exit sequence where the task may need to block.  Add
      conditional logic in the lower end of the eixt logic kicked off by
      _exit() to prohibit blocking after the task has been torn down and is
      no longer cabable of blocking (2014-4-23).
    * arch/arm/src/common/up_initialize.c: Add missing registration
      of /dev/zero.  Registration of /dev/null should depend upon
      conditional compilation.  From Ken Pettit (2014-4-24).
    * arch/*/src/common/up_initialize.c:  Same change required to other
      architectures (2014-4-24).
    * arch/arm/src/kl/kl_clockconfig.c and configs/freedom-kl25z/include/board.h:
      Modify out PLL configuration so that it uses the values in
      board.h;  Fix PLL settings in board.h so that the correct core
      and bus clock frequencies are generated. (2014-4-24).
    * arm/src/kl/chip/kl_memorymap.h, kl_sim.h, andkl_uart.h:  Correct some
      register definitions (2014-4-25).
    * arch/arm/src/kl/Kconfig, kl_lowputc.c, kl_serial.c, and kl_config.h:
      No UART3-5 (2014-4-25).
    * arch/arm/src/kl/kl_serial.c:  Various fixes to various files in the
      KL architecture directory as need to get the interrupt-driven
      serial driver to work.  The Freedom KL25Z NSH configuration now
      works (2014-4-25).
    * include/nuttx/assert.h, arch/*/src/*/up_assert.c, and other file:
      Remove up_assert_code().  While asserting with an encoded value
      could be a good feature, the codes have not be well utilized nor
      documented.  Give that situation it is better to remove the API
      and reduce the footprint a little (2014-4-25).
    * drivers/serial/Kconfig and arch/*/src/*/*_serial.c:  Add
      compilation so that the useless TIOCSERGSTRUCT ioctl logic
      is not build unless CONFIG_DEBUG and CONFIG_SERIAL_TIOCSERGSTRUCT
      are defined.
    * sched/task_delete.c and task_terminate.c:  Most task_terminate()
      out of task_delete.c into its own C file.  This should prevent
      dragging task_delete() into the link when it is never called.

apps-6.27 2013-04-28 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * apps/system/ramtest:  Add a simple memory test (2013-03-26).
    * apps/examples/ostest:  In the non-cancelable thread test, we need
      to give the thread an opportunity to run and to set the non-
      cancelable state.
    * apps/nshlib/nsh_ddcmd.c: Correct the test of the skip input
      parameter.  Was limiting the range to &lt;= count.  From Ken
      Petit (2014-4-24).

NxWidgets-1.7 2013-04-28 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * NxWidgets bitmap_converter.py: Fix bug when image width &gt; 255.  From
      Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWM::CScrollbarPanel:  Fix spelling error in class name: CScollbarPanel
      should be CScrollbarPanel.  From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWidgets:: CGlyphButton: Generate action event, like CButton does.
      From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWidgets:: CGlyphButton:  Prevent drawing outside of the bitmap size.
      From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWM::CTaskBar:  Add option CONFIG_NXWM_TASKBAR_NO_BORDER to suppress
      drawing of the border on the taskbar.  From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWidgets::CNxTimer:  Add function to check if CNxTimer is running.
      From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).
    * NxWidgets::CNxWidgets:  Allow overriding of the checkCollision() method.
      From Petteri Aimonen (2013-4-22).

uClibc++-1.0 2011-11-05 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * The initial release of the uClibc++ implementation of the standard
      C++ library for NuttX.  This package was contributed ay Qiang Yu and
      David for the RGMP team.

buildroot-1.12 2011-13-15 &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * Fix typo toolchain/gdb/Config.in that prevented GDB 7.4 from building
      (from Ken Bannister).
    * Add support for a Cortex-M0 toolchain based on GCC 4.6.3.

pascal-3.0 2011-05-15 Gregory Nutt &lt;gnutt@nuttx.org&gt;

    * nuttx/:  The Pascal add-on module now installs and builds under the
      apps/interpreters directory.  This means that the pascal-2.1 module is
      incompatible with will all releases of NuttX prior to nuttx-6.0 where the
      apps/ module was introduced.
