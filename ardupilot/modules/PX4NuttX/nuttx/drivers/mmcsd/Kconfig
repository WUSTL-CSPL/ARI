config MMCSD_NSLOTS
	int "Number of MMC/SD slots"
	default 1
	---help---
		Number of MMC/SD slots supported by the
		driver. Default is one.

config MMCSD_READONLY
	bool "Disable MMC/SD write access"
	default n
	---help---
		Provide read-only access.  Default is
		Read/Write

config MMCSD_MULTIBLOCK_DISABLE
	bool "Disable MMC/SD multiblock transfer"
	default n
	---help---
		Use only the single block transfer method.
		This setting is used to work around buggy SDIO drivers that cannot handle
		multiple block transfers.

config MMCSD_MMCSUPPORT
	bool "MMC cards support"
	default y
	---help---
		Enable support for MMC cards

config MMCSD_HAVECARDDETECT
    bool "MMC/SD card detection"
    default y
    ---help---
        SDIO driver card detection is
        100% accurate

config MMCSD_HAVE_SDIOWAIT_WRCOMPLETE
    bool "Use SDIO_D Busy to detect Write Complete"
    default n
    ---help---
        SDIO driver will use SDIO_D Busy signaling to detect Write Complete.
        This option when selected, will enable the MMCSD driver to use the
        underlying (stm32_sdio only) drivers implementation of the SD specs
        SDIO_D Busy signaling to detect Write Complete. This will avoid
        potentially very long (600Ms+) busy waiting in the MMCSD driver.
        To implement SDIO_D Busy signaling, the underlying driver must
        be capable of switching the GPIO_SDIO_D0 to be a rising edge sensitive
        interrupt pin. It must then, condition that pin to detect the rising edge
        on recipet of SDWAIT_WRCOMPLETE in the SDIO_WAITENABLE call and
        return it back to regular SDIO mode, when either the ISR fires or pin is
        found to be high in the SDIO_EVENTWAIT call.

config MMCSD_SPI
	bool "MMC/SD SPI transfer support"
	default y
	depends on SPI

config MMCSD_SPICLOCK
	int "MMC/SD maximum SPI clock"
	default 20000000
	depends on MMCSD_SPI
	---help---
		Maximum SPI clock to drive MMC/SD card.
		Default is 20MHz.

config MMCSD_SDIO
	bool "MMC/SD sdio transfer support"
	default n

if MMCSD_SDIO
config SDIO_DMA
	bool "SDIO DMA support"
	default n
	---help---
		SDIO driver supports DMA

config SDIO_MUXBUS
	bool "SDIO bus share support"
	default n
	---help---
		Set this SDIO interface if the SDIO interface
		or hardware resources are shared with other drivers.

config SDIO_WIDTH_D1_ONLY
	bool "SDIO 1-bit transfer"
	default n
	---help---
		Select 1-bit transfer mode.  Default:
		4-bit transfer mode.

config SDIO_BLOCKSETUP
	bool "SDIO block setup"
	default n
	---help---
		Some hardward needs to be informed of the selected blocksize and the
		number of blocks.  Others just work on the byte stream.  This option
		enables the block setup method in the SDIO vtable.
