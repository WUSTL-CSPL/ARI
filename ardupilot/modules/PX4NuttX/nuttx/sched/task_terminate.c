 * Name: task_terminate
 *
 * Description:
 *   This function causes a specified task to cease to exist. Its  stack and
 *   TCB will be deallocated.  This function is the internal implementation
 *   of the task_delete() function.  It includes and additional parameter
 *   to determine if blocking is permitted or not.
 *
 *   This function is the final function called all task termination
 *   sequences.  task_terminate() is called only from task_delete() (with
 *   nonblocking == false) and from task_exit() (with nonblocking == true).
 *
 *   The path through task_exit() supports the final stops of the exit(),
 *   _exit(), and pthread_exit
 *
 *   - pthread_exit().  Calls _exit()
 *   - exit(). Calls _exit()
 *   - _exit().  Calls task_exit() making the currently running task
 *     non-running. task_exit then calls task_terminate() (with nonblocking
 *     == true) to terminate the non-running task.
 *
 *   NOTE: that the state of non-blocking is irrelevant when called through
 *   exit() and pthread_exit().  In those cases task_exithook() has already
 *   been called with nonblocking == false;
 *
 * Inputs:
 *   pid - The task ID of the task to delete.  A pid of zero
 *         signifies the calling task.
 *   nonblocking - True: The task is an unhealthy, partially torn down
 *         state and is not permitted to block.
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   OK on success; or ERROR on failure
 *
 *   This function can fail if the provided pid does not correspond to a
 *   task (errno is not set)
 *
