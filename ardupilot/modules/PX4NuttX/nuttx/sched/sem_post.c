 * Name: sem_post
 *
 * Description:
 *   When a task has finished with a semaphore, it will call sem_post().
 *   This function unlocks the semaphore referenced by sem by performing the
 *   semaphore unlock operation on that semaphore.
 *
 *   If the semaphore value resulting from this operation is positive, then
 *   no tasks were blocked waiting for the semaphore to become unlocked; the
 *   semaphore is simply incremented.
 *
 *   If the value of the semaphore resulting from this operation is zero,
 *   then one of the tasks blocked waiting for the semaphore shall be
 *   allowed to return successfully from its call to sem_wait().
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   sem - Semaphore descriptor
 *
 * Return Value:
 *   0 (OK) or -1 (ERROR) if unsuccessful
 *
 * Assumptions:
 *   This function cannot be called from an interrupt handler.
 *   It assumes the currently executing task is the one that
 *   is performing the unlock.
 *
