# This script uses the Linux 'indent' utility to re-format C source files
# to match the coding style that I use.  It differs from my coding style in that
#
# - I normally put the trailing */ of a multi-line comment on a separate line,
# - I usually align things vertically (like '=' in assignments),
# - indent puts a bogus blank line at the top of the file,
# - I don't like the way it handles nested conditional compilation intermixed with code.
# - I also indent brackets differently on structures than does not script.
