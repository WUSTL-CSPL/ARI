Welcome to L\+L\+VM.

This documentation describes the {\bfseries internal} software that makes up L\+L\+VM, not the {\bfseries external} use of L\+L\+VM. There are no instructions here on how to use L\+L\+VM, only the A\+P\+Is that make up the software. For usage instructions, please see the programmer\textquotesingle{}s guide or reference manual.\hypertarget{index_main_caveat}{}\section{Caveat}\label{index_main_caveat}
This documentation is generated directly from the source code with doxygen. Since L\+L\+VM is constantly under active development, what you\textquotesingle{}re about to read is out of date! However, it may still be useful since certain portions of L\+L\+VM are very stable.\hypertarget{index_main_changelog}{}\section{Change Log}\label{index_main_changelog}
